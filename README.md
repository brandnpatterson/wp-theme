# Hello Wordpress Theme

Development environment for Wordpress that preprocesses styles, bundles scripts, watches for file changes, and uses live reload

### Prerequisites

1. Start by cloning this repo as a theme of your Wordpress project, rename it to your theme's name with a suffix of -child and then cd to your new child theme

To remove the .git directory and to use this in its own unique repo, run this command
```
rm -rf .git
```

Then rename your directory and run
```
git init
```

2. Set up your proxy
    
    Create your proxy with the pathname of your theme\
    Then define the proxy in your gulpfile

```
let localhost = 'hello-wordpress-theme.localhost';

browserSync.init({
    proxy: localhost
});
```

3. Switch to your theme

    Log into wp-admin and select your new theme


## Getting Started

cd to your theme

then run

```
npm install
```

And run gulp's default task

```
gulp
```

You will see 'Hello Wordpress' open at localhost:3000

## Live Reload

As you change files in the `src` folder, you will see changes reflected in the browser.

### New Files
When adding new files, restart your server so that the new files will be watched
